# mpiBWA

This software allows the alignment of high-throughput sequencing data from fastq files. Those files can be pair or single ended, trimmed or not. 
`mpiBWA` relies on [BWA MEM](https://github.com/lh3/bwa) and on the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard to perform the parallelisation of the alignment processing over multiple cores and nodes of high performance computing clusters.
